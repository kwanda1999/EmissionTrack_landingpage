                    <p>
                        EmissionTrack is a consultancy
                        specializing in emission data analysis and
                        management, focusing on Scope 3
                        emissions and carbon footprinting.

                        Our mission is to help clients achieve
                        sustainability and reduce their
                        environmental impact.

                        We are dedicated to being a leading
                        provider of emission data analysis and
                        management services in South Africa and
                        be recognized globally.

                    <h2>What We Here For</h2>
                    <p>
                        The call for global sustainability is stronger than ever, urging businesses to monitor and cut down
                        on carbon emissions. Surprisingly, only 10% of companies, as per a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) survey,
                        were tracking all their greenhouse gas emissions by 2022. Similarly, a Harvard Business Review article found
                        that just one in 10 companies fully measured their GHG emissions at the same time. Despite the rising importance
                        of emission tracking, it's concerning that many companies haven't taken comprehensive action. This not only
                        affects transparency and efficiency but also undermines global climate change efforts.
